# Thai_Transformer
Thai Transformer (ThaiT) is a family of ViT models designed to automatically classify plutonic rock types in Thailand with high accuracy and generalization. The proposed models incorporate a new Error Linear Unit (new GELU) activation in the position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) and an optimized multi-head attention mechanism with merged Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) projections.
